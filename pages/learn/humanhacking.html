    <h1>Human Hacking</h1>
    <h4>If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the results
        of a hundred battles</h4>
    <p>Information technology has changed over the years, but there’s one thing that remained constant. It’s social engineering. Social engineering has a lot of definitions. Some people call it the art of human hacking, while others call it digital attack techniques. Well, both of the definitions are correct. Social engineering is the manipulation of a human being through different mediums. It can be both online and offline. It all depends on how the attack is executed and how convincing the lie is. Furthermore, social engineering is the most popular attack vector. There are social engineering toolkits available on the Internet. These toolkits can easily help a beginner to begin executing social engineering attacks.</p>
