    <p> Once asked this question to a group of security enthusiasts and I was
        shocked at the answers I received:<br>
        “Social engineering is lying to people to get information.”<br>
        “Social engineering is being a good actor.”<br>
        “Social engineering is knowing howto get stuff for free.”<br>
        Wikipedia defines it as “the act of manipulating people into performing
        actions or divulging confidential information. While similar to a confidence
        trick or simple fraud, the term typically applies to trickery or deception for the
        purpose of information gathering, fraud, or computer system access; in most
        cases the attacker never comes face-to-face with the victim.”
        </p>
    <p>Information technology has changed over the years, but there’s one thing that remained constant. It’s social engineering. Social engineering has a lot of definitions. Some people call it the art of human hacking, while others call it digital attack techniques. Well, both of the definitions are correct. Social engineering is the manipulation of a human being through different mediums. It can be both online and offline. It all depends on how the attack is executed and how convincing the lie is. Furthermore, social engineering is the most popular attack vector. There are social engineering toolkits available on the Internet. These toolkits can easily help a beginner to begin executing social engineering attacks.</p>
